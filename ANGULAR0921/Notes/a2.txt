Web Applications Basics/PreRequisites

- HTML 
   - Markup Language and no programming support
   - All Browsers(clients) understand only HTML for presentation
   - Markup --> in the form of tags <> every tag is an instruction to browser
	<h1> it is telling browser to display content in particular font and size
				|
    using HTML alone only static content can be shown to user with minimum navigation 	functionality but today a web application means 99% dynamic behaviour is required.

- JS ( JavaScript )

   - Scripting Language for HTML
   - Programming support for web
   - All browsers have their own scripting engines to support Javascript
	I.E/Edge --> Chakra engine to support JS
	Chrome --> Javascript engine to support JS
	Browser --> ...... to support JS

    JS is an interpreted translator

   - Initially JS is very complex to write but starting from es 2015 it became slightly 	simple to build by adding OOP concepts	
	es --> stands for ecmascript which is open standard spec for JS

    Ajax* --> Asynchronous Javascript and Xml

- CSS

  - all about presentation
  - Cascading Style Sheets

we use IDE's for programming --> Integrated Development Environments

There are so many paid and free IDE's available and most commonly recommended as well as used today for JS and Angular is VS Code**.

Alternatively Visual Studio, Eclipse can be used.

VS Code -- most light weight and free open source IDE
	-- very powerfull and supports most popular programming languages/environments
